* Chapters

Each file in `src/*.org` corresponds to a chapter.

Each chapter file should begin with

    * Chapter title

* General styling

** Footnotes

Footnotes should be named references, ideally beginning with the filename number. For example, a footnote in =010-introduction.org= might be called =010_1=.

* PDF output

Output-specific style support should go into `style/`.

PDFs are created via pandoc using LaTeX. To change the general LaTeX formatting, edit `style/header.tex`.

To see the out-of-the-box pandoc variables, use

    pandoc -D latex
